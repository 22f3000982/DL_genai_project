# Emotion Classification using NLP (Multi-Label Learning)

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given a piece of English text, predict which emotions are present among the following:
`anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise`

A sample text may belong to **multiple emotions at the same time**, so this is a **multi-label classification task**.

Evaluation Metric → **Macro F1-Score across the 5 labels**

## 📂 Models Implemented (as required in L1 Viva)
| Model Type | Model Name | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| From Scratch | TF-IDF + Logistic Regression | Classical ML baseline |
| Pretrained Transformer | RoBERTa-base | Best performing model |
| Second Transformer | DistilBERT-base-uncased | Lightweight alternative |

All **3 models are tracked using Weights & Biases (wandb)** with metrics such as:
✔ train loss  
✔ validation loss  
✔ Macro F1  
✔ Micro F1  
✔ Accuracy
